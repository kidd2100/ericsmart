This Code is for my Eric's Mart C++ code. As I continue my adventure into programming I will continue to add and adjust code according to the different techniques I have learned.
It is a rather simple program at this point that simply takes a customers total funds, and allows shopping of the aisles. It then totals up customers customers purchase and 
displays their purchase vs their total funds available.
